Ash makes a brief cameo in the animated series The Simpsons, when, in the episode "Postcards From the Wedge," the character Bart Simpson is watching TV while doing his homework, and a parody of the Pok√©mon anime appears on TV, starring Ash (in what appears to be a loose parody of his Diamond & Pearl outfit) and Pikachu.
