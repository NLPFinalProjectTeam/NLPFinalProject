Ronaldo scored crucial goals against Middlesbrough in the 2006–07 FA Cup quarter-final; he scored the equaliser from the penalty spot which ensured a 2–2 draw on 10 March, and he again scored a penalty in the replay nine days later after he was fouled by Jonathan Woodgate, before later being on the receiving end of a reckless tackle from James Morrison for which he received a red card.
