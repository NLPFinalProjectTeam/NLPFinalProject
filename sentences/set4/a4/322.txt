Before the launch of HST, estimates of the Hubble constant typically had errors of up to 50%, but Hubble measurements of Cepheid variables in the Virgo Cluster and other distant galaxy clusters provided a measured value with an accuracy of Â±10%, which is consistent with other more accurate measurements made since Hubble's launch using other techniques.
