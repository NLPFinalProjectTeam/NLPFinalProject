A simple indexer.

I write this code for my Capstone project. Some other member of my capstone team might also use this code for NLP.

As you can see, this code is really simple. Almost an API.


USAGE:
  compile: javac -Xlint -cp ".:lucene-6.6.0/*" -g *.java
  run:     java -cp ".:lucene-6.6.0/*" MyIndexer documentDirectoryName destinationIndexDirectory
           java -cp ".:lucene-6.6.0/*" MyRetriever queryfile indexDirectory hitsPerPage
