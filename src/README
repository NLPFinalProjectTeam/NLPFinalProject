[NOTICE] Very important!


Recommended way of running:

  If the data is  ../data/set1/a1.txt
  Run:  $python answer.py set1/a1.txt question.txt

  For hidden test data, just create ../data/set5/ and put data in it. It will run properly


Not recommended way:

  If the data is ./a1.txt
  Run: $python answer.py a1.txt question.txt





MyIndexer.java and MyRetriever.java


A simple indexer and retriever based on Lucene-6.6.0.

I write this code for my Capstone project. Some other member of my capstone team might also use this code for NLP.

As you can see, this code is really simple. Almost an API.


USAGE:
  compile: javac -Xlint -cp ".:lucene-6.6.0/*" -g *.java
  run:     java -cp ".:lucene-6.6.0/*" MyIndexer documentDirectoryName destinationIndexDirectory
           java -cp ".:lucene-6.6.0/*" MyRetriever queryfile indexDirectory hitsPerPage
