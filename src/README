[NOTICE] Very important!


Recommended way of running:

  If the data is  ../data/set1/a1.txt
  Run:  $python answer.py set1/a1.txt question.txt

  For hidden test data, just create ../data/set5/ and put data in it. It will run properly


Not recommended way:

  If the data is ./a1.txt
  Run: $python answer.py a1.txt question.txt
